/* Hello Admin:
Make an array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing
code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and
print a greeting to each user:
• If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a
status report?
• Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.*/
// Array of usernames
var usernames = ['admin', 'Eric', 'Babar Azam', 'Saim Ayub', 'Rizwan'];
// Loop through the array and print greetings
usernames.forEach(function (username) {
    if (username.toLowerCase() === 'admin') {
        console.log('Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?');
    }
    else {
        console.log("Hello ".concat(username, ", thank you for logging in again."));
    }
});
