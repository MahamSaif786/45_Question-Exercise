/* Favorite Fruit: 
Make an array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that 
check for certain fruits in your array.
• Make an array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
• Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array. If the fruit 
is in your array, the if block should print a statement,
such as You really like bananas!*/
