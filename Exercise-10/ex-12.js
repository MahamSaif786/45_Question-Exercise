/*Greetings:
Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be
 personalized with the person’s name.*/

console.log("Hello ".concat(friendName[0], ", how are you?"));
